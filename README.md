## Meeting Background Maker - Client

(companion to Meeting Background Maker Server)

### Getting Started

Visit the Cooper Hewitt Museum API website, and review their documentation: https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/api/
You'll need to create an access token (it's free): https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/api/oauth2/authenticate/like-magic/
This token is secret. You'll need it for this app's server, which is in a different repo:  "snphillips/meeting-background-maker-server"

Clone this repo:

`git clone https://github.com/snphillips/meeting-background-maker-client.git`
 
Run npm to install all the dependencies:

`npm install`

Start the React server:

`npm start`

Your browser should open to http://localhost:3000/ Voila!

You wont be able to do much without the server for this app running. See the repo "snphillips/meeting-background-maker-server" to get started with that.
